# Prog-Fund-3-Lab-3
This lab tests my lab partner's backwardsIterative function against my backwardsRecursive for the time it takes to write bible.txt backwards.

The driver is timeTrialDriver.cpp.

The recursive algorithm has a max depth it goes before refreshing the stack, removing the normal stack overflow limit recursive algorithms reach.
